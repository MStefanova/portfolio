        <h1>You are not familiar with PlayStation?</h1>
        <h2>You like adventures? <br> You want to try something different and exciting?</h2>
        <p>Let me quickly show you round and together will find the incredible world of <em>PlayStation</em></p>
        <h3>Let`s start with a few facts about PS</h3>
        <p>Playstation is a video game console developed by <strong>Sony</strong>. The first Playstation was released in
            1994, followed
            by
            Playstation 2 (PS2) in 2000 and Playstation 3 (PS3) in 2006.</p>
        <p>The most recent PlayStation arrived in 2020, but there is never a wrong time to talk about what is coming
            next.
            Based off a 2021 job listing from Sony that suggests the development of a new console, we can assume that
            the
            PS6 release date will be around 2026.
        </p>
        <p class="top3">Marvel's Spider-Man is the best seller with 20 <br> million copies sold
            <br> <img class="best" src="ps_images/download.jpg">
        <p class="top3"> Followed by God of War with 19.5 million<img class="best" src="ps_images/god-of-war.jpg"
                alt="">
        </p>

        <p class="top3">And number three <br>

        <p>The PS5 second birthday was just a month ago and is proving as popular as ever. And that's no surprise as
            it's a fantastic gaming machine, offering a true generational leap over the PS4.
            Not only does the PS5 offer 4K gaming, but it has also seriously advanced haptics, a speedy SSD, and
            immersive 3D audio. All of these and more combine to deliver a console that's truly equipped for next
            generation
